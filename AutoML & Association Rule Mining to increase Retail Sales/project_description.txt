I used the Pycaret Association Rules module (pycaret.arules) to discover relationships between variables in a Retail dataset. 
I Connected the dataset to Power BI, ran a python script to finally analyze the data and obtain insights. 
The objective is to determine which are the clients that generate the highest profitability, 
what these types of clients buy, and the probabilities that a client will buy a product related to their previous purchases. 
In this way, a promotion strategy can be designed to increase sales.
